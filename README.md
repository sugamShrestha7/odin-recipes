# odin-recipes
This recipe project reflects the learning of HTML.<br>
Different tags are used here: html, head, body, title, meta tags, h1, h2, img, a, ul, ol, li.<br>
The most important thing I learnt in this project is using git and github. adding to the staging area and committing and push the document from local machine to the remote.
