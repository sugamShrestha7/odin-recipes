    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Cuban mojito is very similar to the drinks I enjoyed in Varadero, Cuba. The muddling and the order of the ingredients helps ensure that all the flavors are well blended. Serve with a straw and a decorative stir stick to keep the different flavors well mixed together.</p>

    <p>Mojito is a traditional Cuban punch. The cocktail often consists of five ingredients: white rum, sugar (traditionally sugar cane juice), lime juice, soda water, and mint.[1][2] Its combination of sweetness, citrus, and herbaceous mint flavors is intended to complement the rum, and has made the mojito a popular summer drink.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 lime, cut into 4 wedges</li>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh mint</li>
        <li>2 cups crushed ice, or as needed</li>
        <li>Â½ cup white rum</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place 1 teaspoon sugar each into two 12-ounce glasses.</li>
        <li>Place 2 mint sprigs into each glass.</li>
        <li>Fill each glass about half full with crushed ice. Pour 1/4 cup rum into each glass.</li>
        <li>Fill the glasses with club soda, stir, and garnish with remaining lime wedges.</li>
    </ol>
